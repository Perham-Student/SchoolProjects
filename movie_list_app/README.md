# Movie List Application - Course Project (OOP-2)

This repository contains the **Movie List Application**, developed as part of my OOP2 course project. The project is structured to meet the course requirements by applying object-oriented principles and exploring Flutter development using the Dart programming language.

## Project Structure
- **movie_project/flutter_movie_app/**: Contains the Flutter-based movie list application. Refer to the **README.md** in this folder for app-specific details.
- **Classdiagram.puml**: This is the autogenerated class diagram created based on the application's codebase. It provides a visual representation of the classes and their relationships.  
  *Source*: [dcdg package](https://pub.dev/packages/dcdg/versions/3.0.0)
- **courseproject_diagram.asta**: This file contains both a manually created class diagram and sequence diagram. It reflects my interpretation of the application's logic, inspired by the autogenerated diagram.

## How to Use
1. **Explore the diagrams**:
   - **Classdiagram.puml**: View for an autogenerated representation of the application's structure.
   - **courseproject_diagram.asta**: Open for a self-made version, providing a simplified take and additional commentary.
2. **Access the application code**:
   - Navigate to the `movie_project/flutter_movie_app/` folder for the codebase and further documentation.

## Notes
- The **autogenerated diagram** provides a precise mapping of the application's classes, while the **manually created diagrams** focus on simplified explanations and insights into the design logic.
- This project demonstrates my experience in object-oriented design and my first hands-on exploration of Flutter development practices.
